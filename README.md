# Project-Loop
This is the super duper top secret codename for our game project that will be submitted to the 2025 GMTK Game Jam.

# Overview
We have a fwe ideas but tbh nothing concrete yet... eventually we'll update it

# How To Play
TBD - we honestly don't know what the game is going to be at the moment but it should be as simple as launching the executable and using basic controls (WASD/Arrow + Space / Shift / Control)

# How Were The Sandwiches?
We made a bunch of Sandwiches at the start of the game jam and they were really good.
